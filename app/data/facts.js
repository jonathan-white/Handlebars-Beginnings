		"info":"The invention of the ice cream cone is attributed to Charles E. Menches of Akron in 1903. According to legend, the young ice cream salesman at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition gave an ice cream sandwich and flowers to the girl he was with. She took one of the cookie layers and rolled it into a cone to act as a vase, thus inspiring the ice cream cone. In reality, Menches ran out of cups for the ice cream he was selling so he improvised and made his own containers by wrapping a warm thin waffle around a cone-shaped tool used for splitting thick rope.",

Early land developers decided on the area as the best place for the Ohio & Erie and the Pennsylvania & Ohio canals to meet. In fact, the second highest point in the entire state of Ohio (1,100 feet), just west of the intersection of West Market Street and Portage Path, is but a few feet from the Junior League of Akron's headquarters.`,

		"info":`Charles E. Menches is credited as the inventor of the hamburger. At the 1885 Erie County Fair in Hamburg, New York, he ran out of sausage at his booth, so he bought five pounds of beef, chopped it into small pieces, and seasoned it with brown sugar, salt, pepper, and coffee. It was a tremendous success, and hamburgers made from the original recipe are still being served at the Menches Brothers Family Restaurants in the Akron area.`,
