			<h1>Our Beginnings</h2>

			<p>For the past 75 years, the Junior League of Akron has worked diligently to meet the needs of the community as is reflected by its mission statement:</p>

			<blockquote>
				The Junior League of Akron empowers women for positive change in our community.
			</blockquote>

			<h3>Our History</h3>
			<p>The Junior League of Akron began in 1923 as the Junior Charity League, founded with 67 members who wanted to make a difference in the community.</p> 
			<p>The core of the Charity League was formerly the Babies Aid Society of Children's Hospital.</p> 
			<p>In 1926, the Junior Charity League was accepted into the Association of Junior Leagues International, Inc. and became the Junior League of Akron, Ohio.<p> 
			<p>Today, this strong organization of trained volunteers boasts over 600 members committed to the shared vision of being <span class="vision-statement">"recognized as a leading catalyst and partner in creating collaborative solutions for community change."</span></p>

			<h3>Our Journey</h3>
			<p>Over the years this vision has fueled many beginnings from which the community has benefited.<p> 
			<p>As from the start, Junior League of Akron members continue to donate their time, talent, and energy to a number of community projects to help make our area a better place.</p> 
			<p>The list below reflects a few of the many projects that were started, refined, and transferred to the community for ongoing operation thanks to the financial and volunteer resources from the Junior League of Akron.</p>
